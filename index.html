    <h1>FortNite: Save The World</h2>
    <p>Hello! I am going to teach you about Fortnite Save The World! It is very fun! The first thing you should know about forntie save the world is that 98% of the worlds population has<b>VANISHED!</b> and zombies have averred (called husk's) and my theory is that they turned into the husk's! It is up to you and the remaining 2% of the world to make babies! Not seriously though you have to shot the monsters with... you gassed is cocked and loaded <b> GUNS!</b> and swords and grenades and hammers etc. etc. </p>
    <p>The game starts with a cut scene it tells you the 98% of the people vanished etc. you run up to a place with a robot he I mean <em>she</em> thinks it is a drill you tell her it's not she tells you they were to prevent it from happening someone calls they tell you something you put on a head set and sort of control the caller? Battle some husk's learn the basics then you run up and save some people set some traps launch a <strong>ROCKET</strong> (seriously!) run out battle more husk's win go to the menu get some v-bucks and llama piñatas hit them brake them get loot learn how to go to places and then get missions and do that for the rest of the game!</p>
    <p>Now that you know what happens it is time you know what you are up against!</p>
